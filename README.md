### To the nerds out there
> We made Better-Lab as we got frustrated to their buggy interface with RAM-hogging code editor (SRM uses Cloud9 Web IDE by AWS which is considered the worst web ide possible). As we had the core mechanics in our hand like [Execoder](https://execoder.vercel.app) and [CodeBoard](https://codeboard.tech) (which uses CodeMirror, a far better web ide) we decided to build with it.
