# Better-Lab

A better alternative to SRM-Elab made by the SRM DLD (Directorate of Learning and Development) team.

## Why Better-Lab ?

- Mobile-First approach
- Faster and Snappier animations
- Efficient (~90% performance improvements)
- Better User-Experience
- Auto Sync with srm-elab and Better-Lab
- Support for all browsers possible

### To the nerds out there

> We made Better-Lab as we got frustrated to their buggy interface with RAM-hogging code editor (SRM uses Cloud9 Web IDE by AWS which is considered the worst web ide possible). So we decided to build with the knowledge we had.
